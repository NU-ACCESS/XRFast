**Abstract:** *To be put here*

***

The aim of this repository is to give full access to the Jupyter notebook, associated macros, test dataset, and instructions allowing the reduction and visualization of visible spectral images of works of art as well as pigments identification and their spatial distribution using UMAP, 2D histogram peak finding algorithm and non-negative least square fitting to the original data. 

The intention is that the presented research can be fully replicated and implemented by other scientists in their host institutions. 

Efforts have been made to the best of the authors' abilities to make the data processing procedures accessible and reusable in support of the growing Open Science movement.
