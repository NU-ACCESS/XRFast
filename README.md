**Abstract:** *To be put here*

***

The aim of this repository is to give full access to a Julia package called XRFast designed for dictionary learning of XRF signals, a Jupyter notebook showing how to use this package, a test dataset, and instructions allowing for the idnetification of spectral endmembers and their spatial distribution across a 2D work of art.

The intention is that the presented research can be fully replicated and implemented by other scientists in their host institutions. 

Efforts have been made to the best of the authors' abilities to make the data processing procedures accessible and reusable in support of the growing Open Science movement.
